# SimulateEvolutionClimate

The simulation functions are in `FunctionSimuls.R`.

An exploration of the simulations is in `TestSimulations.Rmd`.

Keep track of how we simulate data for analysis in `Simulationlog.Rmd`. Once simulations are run, we save them in `SimulatedData/`. Once models are run, we save them in `RunModels/`. We will need to create a convention to stamp data creation and associate the data to the models.

An outline of the internship plan is in `InternshipPlan.Rmd`.
